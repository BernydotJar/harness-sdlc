# harness-sdlc

Spec-driven agentic delivery for shippable software.

`harness-sdlc` is a reusable development harness for building applications with AI agents without letting the agent drift, overbuild, or silently change scope.

It combines:

- Spec-Driven Development
- Loop Engineering
- agent role separation
- evidence-backed product ownership before specification
- reusable skills
- OpenCode command contracts
- Context7 documentation checkpoints
- human approval gates
- file-bound execution
- automated verification
- quality gates
- production-readiness criteria
- review artifacts
- decision records
- portable examples
- documented technical debt

The goal is not to generate throwaway prototypes.

The goal is to ship product increments through controlled agentic workflows.

## Modes

### MVP Mode

For fast, validated prototypes.

MVP Mode still requires specs, bounded scope, tests, and review, but keeps production gates lightweight.

### SHIP Mode

For shippable product increments.

SHIP Mode requires production-grade engineering standards before a feature can be closed, including security, data correctness, performance, failure modes, accessibility, observability readiness, tests, and operational constraints.

## Core Lifecycle

```text
pending -> spec_ready -> approved -> in_progress -> review -> done
```

Additional stop state:

```text
blocked
```

## Gate Stack

```text
MVP  : spec + bounded scope + tests + verification + review
SHIP : MVP + security + data correctness + performance + failure modes
       + accessibility + observability readiness + operations
```

## Repository Structure

  .claude/agents/
  skills/
  adr/
  docs/
  templates/
  examples/
  progress/
  specs/
```

## Control System

```text
agents    = roles
commands  = operational actions
skills    = specialized reusable capabilities
templates = reusable artifact formats
docs      = policy and methodology
adr       = why major decisions exist
examples  = small portable reference shapes
```

Harness SDLC is not a prompt collection.

It is a reusable control system for shipping software with AI agents.

## Product Discovery Layer

The Product Owner role operates before feature specification when a product mandate is broad, multi-jurisdictional, financially sensitive, or not yet tied to a verified application repository.

It produces reviewable product memory:

- product brief and outcomes;
- capability and dependency map;
- thin but complete production slices;
- regulatory register with authoritative sources and professional gates;
- open decisions;
- readiness assessment for later graph execution.

Product discovery never authorizes application implementation. The Spec Author still converts one bounded increment into a feature spec, and human approval remains mandatory.

See `examples/ido-erp/` for a SHIP-mode ERP/SaaS example beginning with Colombia and Guatemala.

## First Workflow

The initial feature is `001-harness-bootstrap`.

Current state:

- Feature 1 is specified.
- Feature 1 is set to `spec_ready`.
- Implementation has not started.
- Human approval is required before moving to `approved`.

Run:

```sh
./init.sh
```

## Philosophy

AI agents should not be treated as chatbots that randomly edit your repo.

They should operate inside a harness.

The harness defines the context, tools, memory, permissions, workflow, verification gates, and review process that allow agents to contribute to real software delivery.

One repo. Two modes. Shippable software.
